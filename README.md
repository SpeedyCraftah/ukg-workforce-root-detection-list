A list of ways I found the UKG Workforce (formally known as Kronos) app uses to check for root access.

(by the way android root users can still use your web dashboard which does the same thing as your app ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±)

## Ways that the Kronos (or UKG workforce) app checks for root or modifications to device:
- Checks if your phone is in `release` mode and if USB debugging is active (AKA `adb`).
	- Might be checking for release mode via `getprop ro.build.type`!=user or `getprop ro.debuggable`!=0?
- Checks if you are emulating or spoofing anything.
	- Checks if your location setting is spoofed or uses a mock provider `isFromMockProvider`.
	- Could be doing other things as well but I didn't want to spend too much time looking into this.
- Checks if your device is using test keys by looking for `"test-keys"` in the props string. 
	- Likely does this by either by reading some `build.prop` properties or through `getprop ro.build.fingerprint`.
- Checks if your device has SU binaries or files associated with root access accessible anywhere commonly known.
	- Specifically, it checks for: `/system/app/Superuser.apk`, `/sbin/su`, `/system/bin/su`, `/system/xbin/su`, `/data/local/xbin/su`, `/data/local/bin/su`, `/system/sd/xbin/su`, `/system/bin/failsafe/su`, `/data/local/su`, `/su/bin/su`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-server-15.1.1-android-x86`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-core-devkit-15.1.3-android-arm.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-core-devkit-15.1.3-android-arm64.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-core-devkit-15.1.3-android-x86.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-core-devkit-15.1.3-android-x86_64.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gadget-15.1.3-android-arm.so.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gadget-15.1.3-android-arm64.so.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gadget-15.1.3-android-x86.so.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gadget-15.1.3-android-x86_64.so.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gum-devkit-15.1.3-android-arm.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gum-devkit-15.1.3-android-arm64.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gum-devkit-15.1.3-android-x86.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gum-devkit-15.1.3-android-x86_64.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gumjs-devkit-15.1.3-android-arm.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gumjs-devkit-15.1.3-android-arm64.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gumjs-devkit-15.1.3-android-x86.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-gumjs-devkit-15.1.3-android-x86_64.tar.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-inject-15.1.3-android-arm.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-inject-15.1.3-android-arm64.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-inject-15.1.3-android-x86.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-inject-15.1.3-android-x86_64.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-server-15.1.3-android-arm.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-server-15.1.3-android-arm64.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-server-15.1.3-android-x86.xz`, `/data/local/tmp/frida-server-15.1.3-android-x86_64.xz`
- Checks if you have any "dangerous" props set.
	- Checks if `ro.debuggable` is `1`.
	- Checks if `ro.secure` is `0` (I think anyways, `ro.secure` being `1` means device is in a "secure" state with `0` meaning it's running with disabled security features or some debug mode.
- Checks if any of the following directories are accessible/can be opened?
	- Checks for these directories: `/data/local/`, `/data/local/bin/`, `/data/local/xbin/`, `/sbin/`, `/su/bin/`, `/system/bin/`, `/system/bin/.ext/`, `/system/bin/failsafe/`, `/system/sd/xbin/`, `/system/usr/we-need-root/`, `/system/xbin/`, `/cache`, `/data`, `/dev`, `/data/dalvik-cache`, `/data/app`, `/system/app`, `/system/usr`, `/data/data`.
	- I'm not certain if this is what it does since the logging is a bit misleading, but from experience a normal app should not be allowed to access these directories, nor should some of them like `we-need-root` exist so just make sure all of these either return `Permission denied` or `No file or directory`.
- Checks if the `mount` command exists and returns any interesting paths that are mounted as `rw`.
	- Checks for these specifically: `/system`, `/system/bin`, `/system/sbin`, `/system/xbin`, `/vendor/bin`, `/sbin`, `/etc`.
	- In most devices this command shouldn't be available in a non-root context so as long as you can't use it you should be fine, the app aborts the check if the `mount` command doesn't exist or errors.
- Checks if `which su` command exists and has a non-empty output.
	- Again, in most devices the `which` command doesn't exist in a non-root context and the check aborts if `which su` doesn't exist or returns nothing.
- Checks if any "untrusted" apps are installed on the device via the `PackageManager`.
	- These include: `com.koushikdutta.rommanager`, `com.koushikdutta.rommanager.license`, `com.dimonvideo.luckypatcher`, `com.chelpus.lackypatch`, `com.ramdroid.appquarantine`, `com.ramdroid.appquarantinepro`, `com.android.vending.billing.InAppBillingService.COIN`, `com.chelpus.luckypatcher`, `com.noshufou.android.su`, `com.noshufou.android.su.elite`, `eu.chainfire.supersu`, `com.koushikdutta.superuser`, `com.thirdparty.superuser`, `com.yellowes.su`, `com.topjohnwu.magisk`, `com.devadvance.rootcloak`, `com.devadvance.rootcloakplus`, `de.robv.android.xposed.installer`, `com.saurik.substrate`, `com.zachspong.temprootremovejb`, `com.amphoras.hidemyroot`, `com.amphoras.hidemyrootadfree`, `com.formyhm.hiderootPremium`, `com.formyhm.hideroot`, `me.phh.superuser`, `eu.chainfire.supersu.pro`, `com.kingouser.com`, `com.jrummy.root.browserfree`, `com.oasisfeng.greenifiy`, `com.jrummy.apps.build.prop.editor`, `com.grarak.kerneladiutor`, `org.namelessrom.devicecontrol`, `com.jumobile.manager.systemapp`.
	- I'd like to also point out some of these aren't even root-exclusive apps, for example Greenify has a non-root mode so I guess if you're a non-root Greenify user you're being discriminated against as well.
- Checks if any known tools/names are mapped into the apps process by reading `/proc/PID/maps`, if it's readable.
	- Checks if the read dump contains the strings: `frida`, `frida-agent`, `gum-js-loop`, `gmain`.
	- By the way, just wanted to mention that this was terribly written and is incredibly inefficient and does the same checks on large string buffers multiple times; while it doesn't really matter for one-time start-up root checks, come on, these developers are likely being paid a fortune to write terrible code that I've seen GCSE students (aged 16 & under) write much butter, not even the Java build optimiser was able to save this abomination of a function.
- Checks if any known tools/names (primarily Magisk-related checks) are mounted into the apps process by reading `/proc/PID/mounts`, if it's readable.
	- Checks if the read dump contains the strings: `magisk`, `core/mirror`, `core/img`.
	- You can hide this by adding the app to Magisk Hide.
